ML and experimenting with its application to improve business process.

Discussion :
2 main remittance( act of sending money ) 
Business (SMEs : Small and Medium Enterprise )  
retail : Indivisual 

PROFIT IS THE KEY 
Firstly was the niche of local small customers 

Business have recurring Process 


1stly 
Predict When next transaction of the customers 


Predict who can drop off and deal with the customer likewise 

Why do the customers drop off 
1. Competition : how are they able to charge less : 
   They have huge capital investment
   And the start the have almost 0 or even negative profit 
   Just to get a customer base
   
2. SME also keep multiple remittance partners


Business not only concern about the rates but also business relations with the remittance partner 

Indivisual where as only concerned with rates
